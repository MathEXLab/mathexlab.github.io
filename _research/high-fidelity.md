We develop high-fidelity simulation methods for complex systems described
by partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent work focussed on developing
spectral element methods, both continuous and discontinuous. Recent works
were featured in [SIAM Review](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1345359),
including its cover.
