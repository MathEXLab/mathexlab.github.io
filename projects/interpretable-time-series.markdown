  <h1> Description </h1>
  We are developing a project in collaboration with <a href="https://www.unige.ch/en/">
  University of Geneva </a> (Switzerland), <a href="https://www.santannapisa.it/en">
  Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna </a> (Italy), and <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">
  University of Cambridge </a> (United Kingdom), the latter starting from 2023.
  The primary objective of the project is to develop novel <b>post-hoc interpretability</b>
  tools for neural networks applied to <b>time series</b> and
  <b>sequential data</b>.
