bio: Dr Gianmarco Mengaldo is an assistant professor in the Department
of Mechanical Engineering at National University of Singapore
(Singapore), and Honorary Research Fellow at Imperial College
London (United Kingdom). He received his BSc and MSc in Aerospace
and Aeronautical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Italy),
and his PhD in Aeronautical Engineering from Imperial College
London (United Kingdom).

After his PhD he undertook various roles both in industry and academia,
including at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts,
the California Institute of Technology, and Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods (KBW).

Dr Mengaldo’s primary research area is computational science within
the context of multidisciplinary applications that arise in engineering
and applied science. His main research interests involve (i) the
use of machine learning and statistical tools to predict the behaviour
of complex systems, (ii) the development of data-mining technologies
for the systematic identification of coherent patterns in highly
unstructured datasets, and (iii) the development of high-fidelity
simulations tools for multi-physics problems. Dr Mengaldo’s main
application areas include aerospace and mechanical engineering,
weather and climate, solid earth physics, healthcare, and finance.
