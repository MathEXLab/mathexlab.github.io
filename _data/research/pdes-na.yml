summary: "We are using numerical analysis to develop high-fidelity
  simulation tools for multiscale, multi-physics problems governed
  by partial differential equations. The main focus is on spectral
  element methods, with applications in <b>engineering flow simulation</b>,
  and <b>soft-robotics multi-physics modeling</b>."
# impact:
#   - We developed an index, namely '<b>dyna</b>'
