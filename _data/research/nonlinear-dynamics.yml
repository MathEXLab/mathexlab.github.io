caption: "Lorenz attractor colored by newly developed indices."
summary: "We are developing methods to identify the predictability
  of complex systems. The methods are rooted in dynamical system
  and extreme value theory. These are to be used in conjunction
  with forecasting methods, both traditional and modern, to improve
  their perfomance. Current application areas include <b>extreme weather</b>
  and <b>earthquake modeling and prediction</b>."
# impact:
#   - We developed an index, namely '<b>dyna</b>'
