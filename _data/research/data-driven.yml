summary: "We are developing fast forecasting tools for multivariate
  time series modeling and forecasting. This involve blending
  data compression techniques, such as autoencoders and spectral
  proper orthogonal decomposition, with neural networks. The former
  are used to identify a reduced manifold to decrease the dimension
  of the problem. The latter are used to forecast the system in the
  reduced manifold. Given the 'black-box' nature of neural-network
  approaches, we are developing interpretability methods, to allow
  for more 'white-box' forecasting workflows. Current application
  areas include <b>extreme weather prediction</b>, <b>climate resilience</b>
  and <b>sustaninability</b>, and <b>healthcare</b>."
