PySPOD:
  - summary: "PySPOD implements two parallel versions of the
      spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). These
      are used to identify space-time coherent patterns in
      ergodic data. This method has been extensively used
      in a variety of fields, including fluid mechanics,
      climate and weather, among others."

Nektar++:
  - summary: "Nektar++ is a tensor product based finite element
      package designed to allow one to construct efficient classical
      low polynomial order h-type solvers (where h is the size of
      the finite element) as well as higher p-order piecewise polynomial
      order solvers. The framework comes with a number of solvers
      and also allows one to construct a variety of new solvers."
