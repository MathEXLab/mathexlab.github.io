    Life on Earth has had million years to evolve and adapt
    to the environment. A key of this adaption is the use of
    soft body parts, both in animals and humans, to interact
    with the surrounding environment. Broadly speaking, this
    way of leveraging  the surrounding environment is known
    as <i>embodied intelligence</i>. Its mathematical and
    computational modeling remains elusive. In this paper
    we discuss existing and promising modeling techniques
    that can potentially close this gap, especially
    if interdisciplinary work is pushed forward.

  <div class="content"><h4> Abstract </h4></div>
  <div class="notification is-info is-light">
    Embodied intelligence (intelligence that requires and leverages
    a physical body) is a well-known paradigm in soft robotics,
    but its mathematical description and consequent computational
    modelling remain elusive, with a need for models that can be
    used for design and control purposes. We argue that filling
    this gap will enable full uptake of embodied intelligence
    in soft robots. We provide a concise guide to the main
    mathematical modelling approaches, and consequent computational
    modelling strategies, that can be used to describe soft robots
    and their physical interactions with the surrounding environment,
    including fluid and solid media. We aim to convey the challenges
    and opportunities within the context of modelling the physical
    interactions underpinning embodied intelligence.
    We emphasize that interdisciplinary work is required, especially
    in the context of fully coupled robotâ€“environment interaction
    modelling. Promoting this dialogue across disciplines is a necessary
    step to further advance the field of soft robotics.
