  <div class="content">
  We are hiring 1 Postdoctoral Fellow in dynamical system theory and 
  machine learning for extreme weather forecasting applications. 
  The ideal candidate should be skilled in coding, and software development, 
  and be highly proficient in  Python, large-scale spatio-temporal data
  analysis (ideally the ERA5 and other reanalysis datasets), dynamical 
  system theory, reduced order modelling (including POD, SPOD and Autoencoders), 
  and neural networks. The project is in collaboration with several partner
  institutions: 
  <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int">ECMWF </a>, 
  <a href="https://www.anl.gov"> Argonne National Laboratory</a> (USA), 
  <a href="https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Pisp/davide.faranda/">CNRS </a> (France), 
  and <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk"> University of Cambridge </a> (United Kingdom), the latter starting from 2023. The primary objective of the project is to 
  provide a fast computational framework for extended-range extreme weather 
  forecasts, as well as quantify damage and develop mitigation strategies
  for extreme weather events.
