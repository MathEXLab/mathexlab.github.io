We are developing new computational and mathematical tools, to addressing
the challenges predicting the behaviour of complex systems in engineering
and applied science.

Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, we aim to unlock fundamental
understanding of different aspects governing our interconnected world,
from geophysics to engineering applications.

Our research team is led by Principal Investigator [Dr Gianmarco Mengaldo]().
